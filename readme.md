#About
The Software provides a closed system for users living within an estate to manage their affairs such as Bio-data collection, Dues pament among others.

New Landlord members have to be invited by the Admin. While tenants are invited by their respective Lanlords. When registering a property as a landlord, you can only add property to a street already added by admin. Therefore, streets should have been added by the admin before inviting landlords to add properties.
